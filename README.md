Because gibMacOS currently do not have a way to chose the version of OpenCore to install, I modified the python script let the script point towards this repo.

To make it work, just download this repo and replace the makeinstall.py in youtuber provided package with this one, then you are ready to go.

By the way. if you also got same "Myfilesize cannot find file". while the script is update MBR with boot0af and then it pop up a bootice windows. To solve this just chose the boot0af included in this repo while Bootice windows pop up.

Hope this simple repo will help you get your ryzentosh up and running.
